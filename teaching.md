How do we become a better teacher?

## Disclaimer:

Someone may jump into your desk and ask you something. Irrespective of their experience we have to follow the below approach.

```
1. Standard approach: 
    Just answer a fix.
2. Better approach:
    Use the opportunity to teach someone something, So they can solve their problems in the future.
        . Do they really undertand the problem?
        . Do they really understand the context?
        . Can they identify the root cause?
```

* **Have realistic expectations**. Teaching is a Waterfall and it is not a Agile. People need time, be realistic.
  * You cannot expect them to absorb everything at once.
  * Maybe they are progressing in ways that you haven't noticed.

* **Teaching also benefits the teacher**. Everyone has something to teach. Teaching helps with:
  * Building confidence
  * Solidifying your own knowledge
  * Practicing your ability to communicate effectively
